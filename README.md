# ADC on microcontrollers (Atmega328p) or *Arduino UNO*

This project is intended to show how the ADC (Analog Digital Converter) can be configured in the **ASM** and **C** languages of the AVR microcontroller architecture. This way we can use less memory capacity (Flash memory), compared to arduino, and understand what Arduino is doing when we use the function `analogRead(pin)`

The *ATmega328p* was chosen because it's the uC that is in the **Arduino UNO** and we can make use of its bootloader to not spend on expensive programmer.
